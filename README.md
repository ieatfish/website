# website for practicing

This is a website made for learning Git and [*GitHub*](http://github.com) in general. There is no intention to provide any information to anyone via the website. It is created solely for learning and practicing purposes. It might not work properly and certainly will not look anything like some of the professionally made websites in the market.

After learning and practicing, this website *might be removed and the whole repository deleted without notice*. The purpose is mainly to learn to track changes, back up data, and review my work through the use of Git and GitHub.
